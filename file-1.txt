Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. Ithas roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45BC, makingit over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latinprofessor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up oneof the more obscure Latin words,consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites ofthe word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. LoremIpsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum etMalorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. Thisbook is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comesfrom a line in section 1.10.32.
